# This is a code editor created for experimentations
In this repo I'll be using react components to set up an online code editor

# Usage

First clone this repository 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dric2018/code-editor.git
```

Then, move to the working directory to install dependencies. You need to have npm already instaled.


```
$ cd code-editor
$ npm install
```

You are ready to lunch the web page containing the editor by doing:

```
$ npm start
```
